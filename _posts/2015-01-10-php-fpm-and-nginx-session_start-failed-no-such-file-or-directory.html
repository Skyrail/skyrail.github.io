<p>In setting up nginx and php-fpm I uninstalled Apache (httpd) and in turn that uninstalled the standard php package that Apache uses.</p>
<p>In doing so this deleted some files in the /var/lib/php folder including the session folder (/var/lib/php/session). While logging into phpmyadmin it threw an error complaining about the missing folder.</p>
<p>It's a simple fix, replace the session folder, making sure that the php-fpm process can read and write to it.</p>
<p>I had changed the user php-fpm runs as from apache to nginx to match the nginx user. This can be done in the <code>/etc/php-fpm.d/www.conf</code> file.</p>
<p>Once that's done I ran the following to make it writable/readable by the nginx user.</p>
<pre>
# cd /var/lib/php
# mkdir session
# chown root:nginx session/
# chmod 770 session/
</pre>
