<p>Recently I received the following error while trying to create a table:</p>
<pre>MySQL error code 121: Duplicate key on write or update</pre>
<p>After a bit of research I discovered that the problem was that I had two foreign keys with the same name in the database. Rename one of them and then you're sorted!</p>
