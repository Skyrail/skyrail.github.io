<p>These are a couple of lists I picked up recently with books, articles and other resources in with regards to programming. The first is a list of mainly generic programming books that are ideal if you wish to learn about programming more effectively in general: <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/870/if-you-could-only-have-one-programming-related-book-on-your-bookshelf-what-would">http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/870/if-you-could-only-have-one-programming-related-book-on-your-bookshelf-what-would</a></p>
<p>The second is a list of freely available programming books, usually aiming towards the more specific (especially the first answer)<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/194812/list-of-freely-available-programming-books">: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/194812/list-of-freely-available-programming-books</a></p>
