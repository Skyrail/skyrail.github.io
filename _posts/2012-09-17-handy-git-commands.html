<p>Its been a while since I've posted but I've been getting to know Git a bit better over the past few weeks in an effort to include it as part of our development process.</p>
<p>In the meantime however I'm using it to manage my own files and to merge other developer's work into my own work. Here are just a few of the commands that I've found have helped me so far.</p>
<p>This handy bit lets you compare the differences between two branches with the optional file on the end:<br />
<code>git diff --name-status [branch_one]..[branch_two] [file_path]</code></p>
<p>This displays a nice command line base graph of the commits you've made, each commit taking up just one line with the git message appended to the line:<br />
<code>git log --graph --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit</code></p>
<p>After installing kdiff3 and following <a href="http://davesquared.net/2010/03/easier-way-to-set-up-diff-and-merge.html">this handy run through</a> using git difftool is much nicer when going through file diffs with a co-worker (can be done with branches too as above):<br />
<code>git difftool [commit_one] [commit_two]</code></p>
<p>I may add some more as I get more and more into Git but at the moment they're the few handy ones I can recall.</p>
