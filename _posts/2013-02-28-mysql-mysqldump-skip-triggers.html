<p>In the event of exporting data from one database to another, even if you only export select tables using the --tables option, be sure to add --skip-triggers as well if you don't need them.</p>
<p>We use triggers to duplicate data between our demo databases but one of the triggers broke, breaking all the databases. After fixing the issue and re-importing all of the data from the main demo database we thought it had been fixed. I had forgotten to put in the --skip-triggers option though, so the triggers in the main demo database copied to all the sub-demo databases, creating a recursive loop. Lesson learned.</p>
<p>The error we were getting, just to note, was "Can't update table '&lt;table&gt;' in stored function/trigger because it is already used by statement which invoked this stored function/trigger." and caused a whole chain of databases to fail.</p>
