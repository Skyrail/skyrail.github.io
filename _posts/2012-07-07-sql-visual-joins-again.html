<p>I may or may not have posted a similar link on here before, I can't remember. Whether I have or not, I still look for helpful references and resources, especially regarding MySQL as I've yet to have used it enough to know this stuff off the top of my head. Without further ado, <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/10/a-visual-explanation-of-sql-joins.html">Jeff Atwood gives a good visual overview</a> of JOINs in MySQL.</p>
