<p>I wasn't particularly happy with TortoiseSVN's diff and merge tool so I decided to look for an external tool. I came across <a href="http://www.sourcegear.com/diffmerge/">DiffMerge </a>from SourceGear, a maker of another version control system.  Here's a howto with how to use DiffMerge with TortoiseSVN as taken from <a href="http://www.joechin.com/movabletype/archives/000127.html">here</a> (copied for readability reasons):</p>
<blockquote><p>By default tortoise installs its own diffviewer, tortoisemerge, for viewing and modifying changes. I prefer another. Sourcegear <a href="http://www.sourcegear.com/diffmerge/index.html">diffmerge</a> provides a better user experience and the text is a lot easier to follow. To set tortoisesvn to use a different diffviewer we open settings and select <strong>diff viewer</strong> in the <strong>External Programs</strong> subtree. Select External radiobox.</p>
<p>Enter this text into the dialog box:</p>
<p>"C:\Program Files\Sourcegear\DiffMerge\DiffMerge.exe" /t1=mine /t2=theirs %mine %theirs</p>
<p>Click on <strong>Merge Tool</strong> and select External radiobox. Enter this into the textbox:</p>
<p>"C:\Program Files\Sourcegear\DiffMerge\DiffMerge.exe" /t1=mine /t2=base /t3=theirs /r=%merged %mine %base %theirs</p>
<p>Save and close the dialogbox. Fire up a file that was modified to compare and you'll be using Diffmerge instead of tortoisemerge.</p></blockquote>
