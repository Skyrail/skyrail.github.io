<blockquote>
<p>"Most of Silicon Valley is focused on building products for the top 1% of the world's population.  Most of the world needs solutions to problems we rarely talk about, in areas like health care, agricultural production, sustainable construction, citizen activism and empowerment, childhood education, affordable transportation, supply chain optimization, community solidarity and efficacy, etc.  And I'm not solely referring to base of the pyramid topics (like clean water access), either.  The average "middle class" citizen outside the US doesn't have as much luxury to indulge in existential crisis and loneliness." - Susan Wu (<a title="Quora" href="http://qr.ae/OGjVH">http://qr.ae/OGjVH</a>)</p>

<p>Although referring to Silicon Valley specifically, it does make me reflect on what I'm focusing on in my work and life. </p>
<p>Am I solving problems, or am I just solving 'problems'?</p>
