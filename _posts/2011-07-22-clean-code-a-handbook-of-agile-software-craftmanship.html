<p>My girlfriend recently purchased <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1311337900&amp;sr=1-1">this book</a>Â for me after I had seen it mentioned in a Stackoverflow thread (that I've mentioned in a previous blog post <a href="http://skyrail.wordpress.com/2011/06/27/programming-resource-list/">here</a>). I've just started reading it and I have to say that it's rather well written and I'd recommend it to any programmer who would like to improve in their skills as a programmer in general. The first chapter sums up the reasons for reading the book in the first place "You are reading this book for two reasons. first, you are a programmer. Second, you want to be a better programmer. Good. We need better programmers." So I'd suggest if you'd like to improve in your code writing skills that you pick up a copy and have a read.</p>
