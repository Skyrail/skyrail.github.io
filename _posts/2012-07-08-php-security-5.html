<p>So in line with the SQL injection cheat sheet I posted a couple of days ago, here's a few more links regarding security and PHP, certainly a topic every PHP developer should read up on to ensure their applications and websites are not vulnerable to even the most basic attacks.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.addedbytes.com/writing-secure-php/writing-secure-php-1/">Writing Secure PHP Series (Part 1 link)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://shiflett.org">Chris Shiflet's site</a>, in particular his <a href="http://shiflett.org/articles">articles</a>, although dated are insightful. Writer of the Essential PHP Security book, one I'm intending on getting ASAP.</li>
<li>Find more in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2119083/php-tutorial-that-is-security-accuracy-and-maintainability-conscious">this Stackoverflow post</a> which is where I've thieved the above links from. Thought I'd post them here for my own reference though.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
