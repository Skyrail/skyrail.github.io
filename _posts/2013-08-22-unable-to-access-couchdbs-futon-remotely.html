<p>I'd set up CouchDB on one of my development servers to play around with. Part of that involved messing with Futon, which is CouchDB's web interface. For some reason however I was unable to access the interface from my local machine. </p>
<p>Running <code>netstat -an | grep 5984</code> showed CouchDB to be bound to <code>127.0.0.1:5984</code>, therefore I couldn't access it remotely. After changing that configuration setting (in local.ini) and CouchDB I was still unable to access it.</p>
<p>It turns out that until you stop/kill the Erlang process that CouchDB runs on, it won't reload the config file.</p>
<p>To achieve that:</p>
<p>Find the process number that Erlang/Beam is running on</p>
<pre><code>ps ax | grep beam</code></pre>
<p>Kill the process</p>
<pre><code>kill PID_HERE</code></pre>
<p>Restart CouchDB</p>
<pre><code>/etc/init.d/couchdb restart</code></pre>
<p>And it should now have reloaded your config file.</p>
