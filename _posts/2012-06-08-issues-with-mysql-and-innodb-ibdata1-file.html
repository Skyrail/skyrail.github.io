<p>So as of the past hour the X-Media Online websites have ground to a halt and can't be accessed, after being alerted of the issue I quickly went to investigate. My first port of call is usually to /var/log because I'm ashamed to admit I've let some log files get out of hand before. But this time (thankfully) that wasn't the problem (I'd fixed those issues, hopefully).</p>
<p>This time the issue seems to be in /var/lib/mysql where the ibdata1 file has grown to about 20GB in size which is just shy of the max size of the partition that it's on.</p>
<p>I'm currently in the process of fixing it and will give updates as I go through the process of fixing it. I'm using both <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3456159/how-to-shrink-purge-ibdata1-file-in-mysql">this Stackoverflow post</a> and <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/innodb-data-log-reconfiguration.html">this MySQL documentation</a>. I'm at step one, currently creating a dump of the entire database. I'll keep you updated as I go.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> No update on the fixing yet, but I've determined the root of the problem to be the old X-Media Online wiki which must be open to editing. There are over 17 million records in the wiki text table making up 19.7GB of the 20GB InnoDB file. A lot of mistakes to learn from at this early hour of the morning (it's 2:40am here right now).</p>
<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> Dropped the old wiki database, cleared up the ibdata1 using the <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/innodb-data-log-reconfiguration.html">following documentation</a> but not before reconfiguring InnoDB to use multiple table spaces as per <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/innodb-multiple-tablespaces.html">this documentation</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update 3:</strong> <a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=1341">Bug mentioning the issue</a> for future reference.</p>
