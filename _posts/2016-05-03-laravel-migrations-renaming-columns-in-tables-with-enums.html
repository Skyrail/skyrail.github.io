<p>So in working with Laravel's database migrations feature it appears you can't rename columns in tables which contain enum columns (the issue is noted in their documentation: <code>Note: Renaming columns in a table with a <b>enum</b> column is not currently supported</code> but can be easily missed)</p>
<p>When you do attempt to migrate it may give you an error as follows:</p>
<pre>[Doctrine\DBAL\DBALException]                                                                    
Unknown database type enum requested, Doctrine\DBAL\Platforms\MySqlPlatform may not support it. 
</pre>
<p>The quick away around it I found, while retaining data, is to run the raw query using the <code>DB::statement</code> function:</p>
<pre>DB::statement('ALTER TABLE <i>[table_name]</i> CHANGE <i>[from]</i> <i>[to]</i> <i>[column_definition]</i>'); 
</pre>
<p>Just make sure you add the reverse query in the down function!</p>
