I'm going to be moving my Wordpress blog ([found here][old-blog]) to Github Pages.

Although it's a static blog (based on the [Jekyll Paper][jekyll-paper-website] using [Jekyll][jekyll-website]) I believe it'll give me greater freedom, including control of ads, faster loading speeds, control of content etc.

I also feel like it's a nice time to transition as I move back into the world of software development.

It'll typically be a place where I can post snippets and thoughts - a sort of out-of-memory-memory-bank. Don't expect revelationary content, but hopefully you'll find some bits as helpful as I did.
