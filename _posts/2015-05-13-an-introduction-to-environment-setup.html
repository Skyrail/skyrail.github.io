<p>As there are some differences between the various Linux distributions I've outlined the specifics of my set up here. This should hopefully aid in debugging any issues in the differences between set ups.</p>
<p>This list will continue to grow as I cover more topics although if relevant I'll mention it in the post I first introduce it.</p>
<p>For my base system I use <strong>CentOS 7</strong> with <strong>bash</strong>.</p>
<p>I edit files using <strong>vim </strong>and make use of <strong>tmux</strong> to give me extra workspace.</p>
<p>Access to servers is usually via <strong>SSH</strong> using <strong>Putty</strong> on Windows.</p>
