<p>A little friendly advice, if you're working on multiple databases using <a href="http://www.heidisql.com/">HeidiSQL</a> (a very handy, and free, MySQL tool) I suggest that you change the background colour of each session. For example I set our live/production database server to red, for obvious reasons; the development server in the office is orange and then the server on my local machine is green. It helps to make sure you don't run queries on the wrong machines by accident using this simple visual cue.</p>
