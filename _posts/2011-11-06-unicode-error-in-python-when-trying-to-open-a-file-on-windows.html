<p>When trying to open a file on Windows using Python's open() function I came across a little error that wouldn't allow me to open the file. The error was as follows:</p>
<p><code>SyntaxError: (unicode error) 'unicodeescape' codec can't decode bytes in position 2-4: truncated \UXXXXXXXX escape</code></p>
<p>It turned out the file path I was using (<code>C:\Users\......\SWAN\A1PelamisWave</code>) has a couple of \U's in it which apparently represents a unicode escape. To resolve this I placed an 'r' in front of the file string as follows:</p>
<p><code>file = open(r'C:\Users\......\SWAN\A1PelamisWave', 'r');</code></p>
<p>This causes Python to treat it as a raw string. The answer was found in this helpful <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1347791/unicode-error-unicodeescape-codec-cant-decode-bytes-cannot-open-text-file">StackOverflow post</a>.</p>
