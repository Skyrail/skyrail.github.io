<p>Taken from<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1544642/what-is-your-most-useful-technique-for-finding-or-preventing-bugs/1544652#1544652"> this StackOverflow comment</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Thinking before coding</li>
<li>Fixing bugs or <em>potential for bugs</em> as soon as I see one (not leave it for tomorrow)</li>
<li>Test each little piece of functionality that makes sense on its own</li>
<li>Have it as principle to avoid quick hacks</li>
<li>Use defensive programming techniques everywhere where possible (immutable objects, read-only properties, type constraints etc.)</li>
<li>Write self-explanatory code and comments where code may seem not easy to understand</li>
<li>Avoid sophisticated expressions that require a very fresh state of mind to comprehend</li>
<li>Avoid dense blurbs of code, better make it more verbose to avoid misunderstanding (not saving a few characters on code block brackets helps greatly)</li>
<li>Avoid duplication of code. It will be later next to impossible to trace all instances.</li>
<li>Avoid magic constants in code. Even if you're 200% sure you'll only need it in one place, extract it to a constant. Will do you good.</li>
</ol>
