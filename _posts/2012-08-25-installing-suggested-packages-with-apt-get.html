<p>Every so often there will be a list of 'suggested packages' when you try and install something with apt-get. By default they're not installed which can save installing a lot of stuff you don't really need. Sometimes however you may want to install the suggested packages, I found the '<code>--install-suggests</code>' does just that and can be used as follows:</p>
<pre>apt-get install &lt;package-name&gt; --install-suggests</pre>
