<p>Whenever I push a release I'm required to provide a list of all the files I've changed. As I'm using Git personally I can easily compare the initial import (or last release/import) with the version that I am pushing for release. The simple way of doing this is displayed in the answers in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1552340/git-show-all-changed-files-between-two-commits">this Stackoverflow question</a>. For quick reference the line is as follows:</p>
<p><code>git diff --name-only SHA1 SHA2</code></p>
