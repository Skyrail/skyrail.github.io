<p>Because this has confounded me on multiple occasions and I keep on forgetting to record the solution.</p>
<p>Whenever I create or add an SSH key to my <code>~/.ssh/</code> folder I name it something more memorable e.g. id_github or id_bitbucket (it's wise to have separate keys for separate public repos like these - means you can revoke access on a per-key basis) - this will sometimes confuse Git, as it won't be able to find the id_rsa file it's used to. As such you need to edit the <code>~/.ssh/config</code> file and add in the servers you'd like to connect to and with which key.</p>
<p>I added something like the following. Add a separate block per server.</p>
<pre>Host server.com
    HostName server.com
    User UserName
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/server_private_key
</pre>
