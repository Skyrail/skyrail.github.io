Hey, Iâ€™m Aled.

This is my technical reference blog. I use it as a simple documentation tool and scratch pad to place links and snippets of code for future reference.

I work for ChurchSuite, primarily looking after infrastructure and operations with an eye for process and security.

I have previously worked as a (non-IT) technical manager at Audacious Church looking after the AVL systems, and as a web developer at UKFast Ltd. and SenseLogix Ltd.

I work with whatever is needed to get the job done and am willing to learn from a breadth of topics.

I enjoy spending time with my wife, family, and friends, reading non-fiction and sci-fi books, listening to music, and when I do get out, photography.

I hope you find useful what you find here, and maybe even enjoy it.
