Hey, Iâ€™m Aled.

This is my technical reference blog. I use it as a simple documentation tool and scratch pad to place links and snippets of code for future reference.

I the technical manager at Audacious Church in Manchester, primarly looking after the AVL systems alongside general network and computer management.

I have previously worked as a web developer at UKFast Ltd. and SenseLogix Ltd.

I work with whatever is needed to get the job done although my core tools are PHP and JavaScript.

I enjoy spending time with my family and friends, reading non-fiction and sci-fi books, listening to music, and when I do get out, photography.

I hope you find useful what you find here, and maybe even enjoy it.
